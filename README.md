Explanation for solution: 
I decided to implement a wave shader for the floor of my scene with a pixelated grass texture. There is also a blue capsule representing the player and a red rectangle representing the opponent.
The reason I did this is because the floor in the game "Punch Out!" is green, and that made me think of grass. I decided to give the grass a wave shader to give the impression that it is swaying due to wind blowing.
I feel that this enhances the original scene because it makes the floor more dynamic and interesting to look at from the texture and the waving effect.

Reason for number of deliverables:
I worked by myself, so I only implemented one shader, and no post processing effect.
